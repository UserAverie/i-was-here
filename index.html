                This website is a place for students to experiment with working in git.

                It is expected that all students will make a change to the code.
                The change should be small and should follow these rules.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    You should make a change to the CSS styles for the page.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should leave your student number somewhere in the visible HTML.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should <strong>not</strong> change the HTML in this section.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You should <strong>not</strong> remove another student number from the code.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Obviously if you take significant effort to update the CSS rules, another student may follow this up with another change that destroys your impact.
                This is just how it is.
                So don't get too precious about it.
                Just try to make an incremental improvement.
